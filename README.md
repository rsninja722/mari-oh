Project for pholiosopy, we have to make something based on Ren√© Descartes. This remake of Super Mario Bros. focuses on Descartes' method of forgeting all previous knowladge, and building knowlage from the ground up. To win the game, the player must block out all assumptions of how Super Mario is played, and discover the game as if they have never known it.
